# beer-buddy

This is a personal beer ranking/rating system. It is also going to serve as a sample app for NKU's CSC 439/539 course. 

This application is built with spring-boot, angular, and material design

#TODO's and Road Map
These are just some features that would be nice to add. Currently the app is really basic...
- [ ] Sync process needs to reject beers that have invalid images.
- [ ] 
- [ ] 
- [ ] 
  - [ ] first subtask #1234
  - [ ] follow up subtask #4321
  - [ ] final subtask cc @mention
- [ ] a separate task
<ul>
  <li></li>
  <li>Need to have an admin section that can rerun the sync process.</li>
  <li>Create a queue-like-request system to where users can request to add beers to the list.</li>
  <li>Add ability for 'admin' users to review submitted new beer requests and approve/edit beer attributes.</li>
  <li>Use spring-security fully and not just implement it manually...</li>
  <li>Support @Secured annotation on rest apis.</li>
  <li>Add search abilities on beer.
    <ul><li>Contextual search like google?</li>
        <li>
  </li>
  <li>With an rest api, it would be nice to build a native android app as well.</li>
</ul>
